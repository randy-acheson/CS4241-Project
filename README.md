Theming Choices
  My webpage is monochromatic, which highlights the color changing that it does. The page is clearly delineated between header and the main portion of the page. This makes it easy for a user to first figure out what to do, and then to do it. The instructions are two simple sentences at the head of the document, and there's an intuitive pause/play button that indicates whether or not the music is currently playing. The squares are spread across the screen to create a challenge for the user.


Technical Achievements
 - Squares are dynamically generated, with one goal square that the user must click on
 - Audio plays when the cursor is close to the goal square, and fades away when the cursor is farther
 - The background color of the page changes from grey to white the closer the cursor is to the goal square
 - The user can pause and play the music with a dynamic play/pause button
 - If the user clicks on something that isn't the goal square, the cursor changes to a red sad cursor for a bit, but clicking the goal square doesn't capture the parent body click
